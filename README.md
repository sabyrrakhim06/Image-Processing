# CA-CS-802 Image-Processing

Instrcutor:  Prof. Dr. Horst Karl Hahn

The module provides a foundation in the theory and applications of digital image processing. The first part will concentrate on morphological image processing, which is one of the most basic yet powerful tool sets in dealing with digital images and it is the backbone of many of today's high-performance image analysis systems. The module starts by introducing concepts such as dilation, erosion, geodesic transformations, morphological filtering, and watershed transform. It then develops into advanced strategies for image segmentation and texture analysis. The second part of the module will concentrate on understanding problems from real world applications, such as in biomedical imaging, and will provide an overview of the broader field of image processing. The course can be combined with other courses on machine learning and signal analysis. Homework assignments will cover C/C++ implementations of basic and combined image processing algorithms
